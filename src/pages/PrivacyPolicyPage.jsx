          Carveeps will retain your Personal Information, including sensitive
          Personal Information, only for as long as is necessary for the
          purposes set out in this Policy. We will retain and use your Personal
          Information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal
          obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to
          comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal
          agreements and policies.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Carveeps will also retain Usage Data (i.e., data collected
          automatically, either generated by the use of the service or from the
          service infrastructure itself, such as the duration of a page visit)
          for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a
          shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen
          the security or to improve the functionality of our service, or we are
          legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.

          However, we have taken appropriate measures to ensure that your
          Personal Information remains protected in accordance with this Policy

          and we will generally provide you with these rights and choices
          subject to some exceptions permitted by law. For example, if providing
          this access may disclose information about another person, or may
          disclose commercially sensitive information, we may need to refuse to
          grant you access. Details about how to contact us are at the end of

          under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) or California Privacy
