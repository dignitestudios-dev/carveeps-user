          (a) EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH
          THESE TOS SHALL BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER
          THAN IN COURT, EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT
          (DEFINED FOR THE PURPOSES OF THESE TOS AS A COURT OF LIMITED
          JURISDICTION THAT MAY ONLY HEAR CLAIMS NOT EXCEEDING $5,000) IF YOUR
          CLAIMS ARE WITHIN THE COURT’S JURISDICTION. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY
          IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.

          rules are available at http://www.adr.org/. Payment of all filing,
          administration and arbitrator fees shall be governed by the AAA’s

          single independent and neutral arbitrator. For any hearing conducted
          in person as part of the arbitration, you agree that such hearing
          shall be conducted in Santa Clara County, California or, if the
          Consumer Arbitration Rules apply, another location reasonably
          convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to
          travel and other pertinent circumstances, as determined by the
          arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding.
          Judgment on the arbitral award may be entered in any court of
          competent jurisdiction.

          (c) WE AND YOU (BY YOUR USE OF THE APP AND SERVICES) EACH AGREE THAT
          ALL CLAIMS SHALL BE RESOLVED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A
          CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR OTHER SIMILAR PROCESS.
          IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN
          ARBITRATION, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND AGREE THAT
          SUCH CLAIM SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION
          IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA. YOU HEREBY SUBMIT TO THE PERSONAL
          JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF SUCH COURTS AND WAIVE ANY OBJECTION ON THE
          GROUNDS OF VENUE, FORUM NON-CONVENIENS OR ANY SIMILAR GROUNDS WITH

          seek injunctive relief and any other equitable remedies from any court
          of competent jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property rights,
          whether in aid of, pending, or independently of the resolution of any
